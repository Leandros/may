May is a high-performance library for programming stackful coroutines with which you can easily develop and maintain massive concurrent programs. It can be thought as the Rust version of the popular [Goroutine][go].

## Features
* The stackful coroutine implementation is based on [generator][generator];
* Support schedule on a configurable number of threads for multi-core systems;
* Support coroutine version of a local storage ([CLS][cls]);
* Support efficient asynchronous network I/O;
* Support efficient timer management;
* Support standard synchronization primitives, a semaphore, an MPMC channel, etc;
* Support cancellation of coroutines;
* Support graceful panic handling that will not affect other coroutines;
* Support scoped coroutine creation;
* Support general selection for all the coroutine API;
* All the coroutine API are compatible with the standard library semantics;
* All the coroutine API can be safely called in multi-threaded context;
* Both stable, beta, and nightly channels are supported;
* x86_64 GNU/Linux, x86_64 Windows, x86_64 macOS, AArch64 GNU/Linux, and AArch64 macOS are supported.

----------

## Usage
A naive echo server implemented with May:
```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate may;

use may::net::TcpListener;
use std::io::{Read, Write};

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8000").unwrap();
    while let Ok((mut stream, _)) = listener.accept() {
        go!(move || {
            let mut buf = vec![0; 1024 * 16]; // alloc in heap!
            while let Ok(n) = stream.read(&mut buf) {
                if n == 0 {
                    break;
                }
                stream.write_all(&buf[0..n]).unwrap();
            }
        });
    }
}

```

----------

## Caveat
There is a detailed [document][caveat] that describes May's main restrictions. In general, there are four things you should follow when writing programs that use coroutines:
* Don't call thread-blocking API (It will hurt the performance);
* Carefully use Thread Local Storage (access TLS in coroutine might trigger undefined behavior).

> It's considered **unsafe** with the following pattern:
> ```rust
> set_tls();
> // Or another coroutine API that would cause scheduling:
> coroutine::yield_now(); 
> use_tls();
> ```
> but it's **safe** if your code is not sensitive about the previous state of TLS. Or there is no coroutines scheduling between **set** TLS and **use** TLS.

* Don't run CPU bound tasks for long time, but it's ok if you don't care about fairness;
* Don't exceed the coroutine stack. There is a guard page for each coroutine stack. When stack overflow occurs, it will trigger segment fault error.

**Note:**
> The first three rules are common when using cooperative asynchronous libraries in Rust. Even using a futures-based system also have these limitations. So what you should really focus on is a coroutine stack size, make sure it's big enough for your applications.
